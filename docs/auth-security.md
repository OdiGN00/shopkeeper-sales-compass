# Authentication & Security Documentation

## Authentication System

### Supabase Auth Integration
- JWT-based authentication with automatic token refresh
- Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant data isolation
- Role-based access control (admin, manager, cashier)

### Key Components
- `AuthContext`: Global authentication state management
- `ProtectedRoute`: Route-level authentication guards
- `UserMenu`: User profile and logout functionality

## Security Features

### Row Level Security Policies
```sql
-- Users can only access their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own customers" 
ON public.customers FOR SELECT 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Role-Based Access
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management
- **Manager**: Business operations, reporting
- **Cashier**: Sales operations, limited access

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Secure password requirements
- Session management with automatic logout
- Audit trail for all data changes

## Authentication Flow
1. User login â†’ Supabase Auth
2. JWT token issued and stored
3. RLS policies enforce data access
4. Automatic profile creation via database trigger
5. Role assignment and permission checking
